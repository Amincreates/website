    <h3>Reasons I joined the Software Development Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>I always enjoy learning about new concepts and ideas. I have had an interest in software development for a long time, but never got a chance to pursue it.
        Although this course is very fast paced, I am really enjoying learning about Javascript, SQL and HTML. So far it's been a very enjoyable experience and hopefully will be a beneficial skillset to have.
    </p>
    <h4>My Progress So Far</h4>
    <p>This is the frst time I have encountered Javascript and SQL, so it's been a very steep learning curve. There will be a lot of work for me to do outside of class time in order to improve my knowledge on the various topics.</p>
